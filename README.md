blink is a go implementation for controlling [ThingM blink(1) USB dual RGB LEDs][1].

## Features

- [x] Fade to RGB color
- [x] Set RGB color now  
- [x] Read current RGB color *(mk2 devices only)*
- [ ] Serverdown tickle/off
- [ ] Play/Pause
- [ ] PlayLoop *(mk2 devices only)*
- [ ] Playstate readback *(mk2 devices only)*
- [ ] Set color pattern line
- [ ] read color pattern line
- [ ] Save color patterns *(mk2 devices only)*
- [ ] Read EEPROM location *(mk1 devices only)*
- [ ] Write EEPROM location *(mk1 devices only)*
- [ ] Get version
- [ ] Test command

Eventually all of the [available HID commands will be implemented][2]

## Installation

Currently blink does only compile on **linux** and requires **[libusb-1.0.12][5] or higher**.
blink is build on travis using libusb 1.0.20. Refer to the [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) to it can be built on ubuntu.
On Fedora 22 you can simply use `dnf install libusb-devel`.

Use `go get` to install blink:
```
go get github.com/fgrosse/blink
```

## Usage

```go
// connect to a local blink(1) USB device
led, err := blink.New()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// make sure its closed when you are done
defer led.Close()

// fade to a full green in 500ms
d := 500 * time.Millisecond
led.FadeRGB(0, 255, 0, d)
time.Sleep(d)

// read the current color
color, err := led.ReadRGB()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", color)

// immediately set the color (0, 0, 0 effectively disables the led)
err = led.SetRGB(0, 0, 0)
```

You need to have root access when running this program or you will get the following error:

```
could not open blink1 device {path:27b8:01ed:01.03 vendorID:10168 productID:493}: libusb: bad access [code -3]
```

On linux this problem can easily be fixed by adding the following [udev rule][6]:

```bash
[root@localhost]# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/10.local.rules
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="27b8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="01ed", SYMLINK+="blink1", GROUP="blink1"
```

Everybody in the `blink1` group should now be able to access the device directly.
Additionally this rule creates a symlink at `/dev/blink1` each time you connect the device.
You probably need to reconnect your device so the change will be visible.
